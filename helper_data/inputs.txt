Prompt:
Rewrite these queries to make them broader rather than specific. The goal is to generate SQL queries that will retrieve comprehensive data for plotting. When a query is too specific, it returns only a single answer or a short list of answers, leaving little to plot. Broader questions should retrieve more columns and rows of data for richer analysis and visualization.
